# DynamicProgramming
Repository for allocating algorithms solved using dynamic programming for the Analysis and Project of Algorithms course at Federal University of Paraiba.

## Implemented Algorithms
* Knapsack Problem (output consists of solution value and chosen objects)

## Compiling and Running:

To compile, just run the command:

```bash
cd Knapsack
make
```

To run the executable:

```bash
./knapsack PATH_TO_INPUT_FILE.txt
```

## Example of output:

```bash
./knapsack Instances/mochila01.txt
```

    Solution Value: 107
    Solution Objects: 1, 2, 6, 7
